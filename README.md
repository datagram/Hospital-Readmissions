# Hospital-Readmissions
Modeling hospital readmissions

The goal of the study is to perform an exploratory analysis on the data provided by a home health provider medical facility. The dataset consists of binary, categorical, and ordinal variables and after performing summary statistics it appears that there are some duplicate recors but there are no missing values. After performing some visualizations on the data, a statistical analysis is conducted. For the purpose of this report, a binary variable indicating readmissions is created and is referred to as the response variable in the logistic regression model.
